## For the Technical Users.
Dolphy AI is an AI app that works different to others. Instead of running AI models on the cloud we do it on-device. There are three reasons why we do this:

**1) It's more private and secure**
<br></br>
**2) I'm kinda poor to afford a server**
<br></br>
**3) No one's really done it yet**

Here's a diagram showing how Dolphy AI works.
